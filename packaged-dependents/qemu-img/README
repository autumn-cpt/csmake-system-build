This project builds the qemu-img dependency for CloudSystem 8.5 builds

You may need your distro's qemu installation to build this package
and to support execution of qemu-img.  
This built version of qemu-img is tested in an environment where 
qemu 1.5 is installed and works well.

If you run into missing dependencies issues not covered here, install 
your distro's version of the qemu suite, then proceed to build

One dependency that will not be resolved by installing qemu is the
dev package for pixman-1 (ubuntu: sudo apt-get install libpixman-1-dev)

Once libpixman is installed, do:
csmake build package

This requires access to the Internet to perform the build.

Alternatively, you can do a git clone of the qemu source (see csmakefile for
location and tag details) into target (or whereever your results directory
you want to use lives) before executing the build to avoid any proxy issues
unresolved in the build.  It may also work to define http_proxy in your shell
environment.

When the build is complete target/debpackage will contain the deb ready
to install.
