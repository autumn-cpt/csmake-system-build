       Flags:
           mount - path to the mount point to capture
       Mappings:
           use a 1-1 mapping.  The rhs will contain an extra axis called
           'used-size'
           It *must* be a single 1-1 mapping that maps a single file to another
           single file - nothing else makes sense given this section
           maps the mountpoint to a raw disk image in the filetracking.
