class SystemBuild(CsmakeModule):
    """Purpose: Set up a system (computer/os install) build.
       Library: csmake-system-build
       Phases: build, system_build - create the definition of the system
               NOTE: When SystemBuild is used as a regular section,
                     SystemBuildEnd must be called before exiting.
       JoinPoints:
               start__build, start__system_build -
                     Will wrapper a section with the releant info for the given
                     system
                   NOTE: Multiple aspects on a section are not guaranteed
                         to execute in a given order
                   Also: It may be a little awkward to have the system
                         build occur as a cross-cutting concern
                         if that's the primary function of the build...
                         on the other hand, ensuring resorces are only
                         reserved for the exact part of the build
                         that is relevant can be done easily by using this
                         section as an aspect on the relevant
                         command or subcommand section
               end__build, end__system_build - will end the wrappering
                     for the system build and free resources related
                     to the system build.

       Options:
           system - A build internal name for the system being created
                    (this is *not* necessarily a host name - just an id so that
                     several systems can be built at the same time)
       Environment:
           __SystemBuild_<system>__ is created that will house all of the
               configuration information for the system.
               The entry is a dictionary:
                   system: pointer to the proper instance of this
                           module for the given system name
                   cleanup_methods: list of methods to call on cleanup
                           of the environment.
                           It is required that these methods be idempotent.
                           The methods will be executed in the
                           order added starting with the last
                   recovery_methods: list of methods to call on final csmake
                                     cleanup.
                           The methods will be executed in the order added
                           starting with the first.
